METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used a large US claims database to identify patients with T2DM who initiated liraglutide or sitagliptin between January 2010 and December 2012. Adults (>/=18 years old) with persistent use of therapy for >/=3 months were included. Changes in glycated hemoglobin A1c (A1C) and the proportion of patients achieving A1C targets (</=6.5% and <7%) were examined at 6-month follow-up. Diabetes-related total, medical, and pharmacy costs over the follow-up period were assessed. Multivariable regression models were used to estimate the outcomes associated with liraglutide relative to sitagliptin, adjusting for differences in patient demographics and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: The study included 1,465 patients with T2DM who initiated liraglutide (N = 376) or sitagliptin (N = 1,089) (mean age [standard deviation (SD)]: 54 [8.9] vs. 58 [10.8] years; 43.9% vs. 61.8% males; both P < 0.01). After controlling for confounding factors, liraglutide patients experienced 0.31% points greater reduction in A1C (0.95% vs. 0.63% points; P < 0.01) at 6-month follow-up than sitagliptin patients and were more likely to reach A1C targets of </=6.5% (odds ratio [OR]: 2.00; P < 0.01) and <7% (OR: 1.55; P < 0.01). Liraglutide patients had $994 lower mean diabetes-related medical costs ($1,241 vs. $2,235; P < 0.01), but $544 higher diabetes-related pharmacy costs ($2,100 vs. $1,556; P < 0.01) during the follow-up. No difference was found in the total mean diabetes-related costs between the two cohorts. CONCLUSION: Liraglutide showed greater improvement in glycemic outcomes than sitagliptin among adult patients with T2DM in real-world clinical practice. Although diabetes-related pharmacy costs for patients using liraglutide were higher compared with sitagliptin, these were offset by significantly lower diabetes-related medical costs, resulting in similar total diabetes-related costs between the two treatment groups.","affiliations":"Evidera, Lexington, MA, USA, Qian.Li@evidera.com.; Novo Nordisk Inc.PlainsboroUSA","articleTitle":"Real-world clinical and economic outcomes of liraglutide versus sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the United States","authors":"Li, Q.; Chitnis, A.; Hammer, M.; Langer, J.","authorsConclusion":"Liraglutide showed greater improvement in glycemic outcomes than sitagliptin among adult patients with T2DM in real-world clinical practice.

This study examines how adherence and persistence to once-daily liraglutide impact glycemic control and economic outcomes in a real-world population of adult type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using administrative claims data from July 2009 through September 2013. Patients aged >/=18 years with T2D treated with liraglutide were identified (index date = first liraglutide prescription). Adherence was based on the proportion of days covered (PDC); with PDC >/=0.80 classified as adherent. Non-persistent patients were those with a gap in therapy of >90 days. Lab results for glycated hemoglobin (A1C) were used to identify whether patients achieved target levels of <7.0% and </= 6.5%, or experienced a reduction of >/=1.0% in A1C from pre-index (baseline) to post-index (follow-up). Logistic regression was used to estimate the likelihood of achieving the A1C goals, adjusted for baseline characteristics. Diabetes-related medical, pharmacy, and total costs were modeled and estimated for the adherence and persistence cohorts. RESULTS: A total of 1321 patients were identified. The mean PDC was 0.59 and 34% of patients were classified as adherent, while 60% were persistent over 12 months of follow-up. Adherent and persistent patients were more likely to achieve each of the A1C goals than their non-adherent and non-persistent counterparts after adjusting for patient characteristics. Adherence and persistence were associated with higher adjusted diabetes-related pharmacy and total healthcare costs during follow-up; whereas persistent patients had significantly lower diabetes-related medical costs than non-persistent patients. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence and persistence to liraglutide are associated with improved A1C outcomes. Persistent patients showed significantly lower medical costs versus those discontinuing liraglutide.

This study examined liraglutide's clinical effectiveness to lower A1C and body weight after 6 months in T2D patients stratified by baseline BMI. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using the General Electric Centricity electronic medical records database. Adult patients with T2D (>/=18 years and BMI>/= 25 kg/m(2)) and A1C >7% at baseline who started liraglutide between January 1, 2010 and January 31, 2013 and who did not use insulin or a glucagon-like peptide-1 analog 12 months before initiating liraglutide (N = 3,005) were selected. Changes from baseline, stratified by BMI, in A1C, body weight, A1C <7% goal attainment, and incidence of severe hypoglycemia at 6-month follow-up were examined.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used integrated medical and pharmacy claims linked with glycated hemoglobin A1C (A1C) results from the IMS Patient-Centric Integrated Data Warehouse. Patients' >/=18 years and naive to incretin therapies during a 6-month pre-index period, with >/=1 prescription for LIRA or EXEN between January 2010 and December 2010, were included. Patients with evidence of insulin use (pre- or post-index) were excluded. Only patients who were persistent on their index treatment during a 180-day post-index period were included. Follow-up A1C assessments were based on available laboratory data within 45 days before or after the 6-month post-index point in time. Diabetes-related pharmacy costs over the 6-month post-index period were captured and included costs for both the index drugs and concomitant diabetes medications. RESULTS: 234 LIRA and 182 EXEN patients were identified for the analysis. The adjusted predicted diabetes-related pharmacy costs per patient over the 6-month post-index period were higher for LIRA compared to EXEN ($2,002 [95% confidence interval (CI): $1,981, $2,023] vs. $1,799 [95% CI: $1,778, $1,820]; P < 0.001). However, a higher adjusted predicted percentage of patients on LIRA reached A1C < 7% goal (64.4% [95% CI: 63.5, 65.3] vs. 53.6% [95% CI: 52.6, 54.6]; P < 0.05), translating into lower average diabetes-related pharmacy costs per successfully treated patient for LIRA as compared to EXEN ($3,108 vs. $3,354; P < 0.0001).

METHODS: Using the Truven Health MarketScan Laboratory Database, glycemic control (A1C <7%) and diabetes-related costs were evaluated in T2D patients initiating liraglutide between January 1, 2010 and June 30, 2012. Patients were required to have >/=1 post-index claim for liraglutide and A1C values at baseline and 6 months follow-up. All valid values of baseline A1C were included. Patients previously treated with GLP-1 receptor agonist(s) or insulin, or with evidence of type 1 diabetes, pregnancy, or gestational diabetes during the study period were excluded. Multivariable regression models were used to identify predictors of glycemic control and diabetes-related costs. RESULTS: Of 417 patients newly treated with liraglutide, 54.0% achieved glycemic control (A1C <7%) during follow-up. Factors associated with increased odds of glycemic control during follow-up were: being female, POS/EPO health plan type, baseline A1C, early liraglutide initiation (0-1 prior oral anti diabetics [OADs] vs >/=2), adherence to liraglutide (defined as the proportion of days covered [PDC]), and diabetic retinopathy.

The aim of the present analysis was to evaluate the short-term cost-effectiveness of once-daily liraglutide 1.8 mg vs once-daily lixisenatide 20 mug as an add-on to metformin for treatment of type 2 diabetes in the US by assessing the cost per patient achieving HbA1c-focused and composite treatment targets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Percentages of patients achieving recommended targets were obtained from the LIRA-LIXI trial, which compared the efficacy and safety of once-daily liraglutide 1.8 mg and once-daily lixisenatide 20 mug as an add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes failing to achieve glycemic control with metformin. Annual costs were estimated from a healthcare payer perspective. An economic model was developed to evaluate the annual cost per patient achieving target (cost of control) with liraglutide 1.8 mg vs lixisenatide 20 mug for five end-points. RESULTS: Annual treatment costs were higher with liraglutide 1.8 mg than lixisenatide 20 mug, but this was offset by greater clinical efficacy, and the cost of control was lower with liraglutide 1.8 mg than lixisenatide 20 mug for all five end-points.

The aim of the present analysis was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of IDegLira vs liraglutide added to basal insulin, for patients with type 2 diabetes not achieving glycemic control on basal insulin in the US setting. METHODS: Projections of lifetime costs and clinical outcomes were made using the IMS CORE Diabetes Model. Treatment effect data for patients receiving IDegLira and liraglutide added to basal insulin were modeled based on the outcomes of a published indirect comparison, as no head-to-head clinical trial data is currently available. Costs were accounted in 2015 US dollars ($) from a healthcare payer perspective. RESULTS: IDegLira was associated with small improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy compared with liraglutide added to basal insulin (8.94 vs 8.91 discounted quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]). The key driver of improved clinical outcomes was the greater reduction in glycated hemoglobin associated with IDegLira. IDegLira was associated with mean costs savings of $17,687 over patient lifetimes vs liraglutide added to basal insulin, resulting from lower treatment costs and cost savings as a result of complications avoided.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a once-daily GLP-1 analog Victoza [Novo Nordisk] versus a thiazolidinedione (TZD), rosiglitazone in patients with T2DM. Both treatment groups included background therapy with glimepiride. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The CORE Diabetes Model (CDM) was used to project and compare 35-year clinical and economic outcomes associated with liraglutide 1.2 mg + glimepiride and liraglutide 1.8 mg + glimepiride versus rosiglitazone 4 mg + glimepiride. Baseline cohort characteristics (HbA(1c) (8.4%), age, duration of disease, sex, body-mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and lipids) were based on the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes-1 (LEAD-1) trial. OUTCOMES: Primary outcomes included life expectancy (LE), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). results: When compared to rosiglitazone, liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg increased mean LE by 0.968 and 1.041 years, and QALYs by 0.764 and 0.837, respectively. Total lifetime costs increased by $26,094 for liraglutide 1.2 mg versus rosiglitazone, and by $47,041 for liraglutide 1.8 mg versus rosiglitazone. ICERs for liraglutide 1.2 mg versus rosiglitazone and 1.8 mg versus rosiglitazone were $34,147 and $56,190, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to rosiglitazone 4 mg plus glimepiride, liraglutide (particularly at the 1.2-mg dose) plus glimepiride is a cost-effective treatment option for improving glucose control in T2DM. Limitations include the projection of short term efficacy results from randomized control trials to longer time horizons.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to determine the long-term cost-effectiveness of incretin-based therapy with once-daily liraglutide (vs twice-daily exenatide) combined with metformin, glimepiride, or both for the treatment of T2DM. METHODS: Patient data were obtained from the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes 6 (LEAD 6) trial. Baseline data included mean HbA(1)(c) (8.15%), age (56.7 years), disease duration (8 years), sex, body mass index, blood pressure, lipid levels, cardiovascular and renal risk factors, and other complications. The IMS Center for Outcomes Research Diabetes Model was used to project and compare lifetime (ie, 35-year) clinical and economic outcomes for once-daily liraglutide 1.8 mg compared with twice-daily exenatide 10 (ig, each used as add-on therapy with maximum-dose metformin and/or glimepiride. Treatment-effect assumptions were also derived from the LEAD 6 trial. Transition probabilities, utilities, and complication costs were obtained from published sources. All outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum, and the analysis was conducted from the perspective of a third-party payer in the United States. RESULTS: The base-case analysis indicated that, compared with exenatide, liraglutide add-on therapy was associated with a mean (SD) increase in life expectancy of 0.187 (0.250) years and an increase in qualityadjusted life-years of 0.322 (0.164) years. Compared with exenatide, total lifetime treatment costs for liraglutide were $12,956 higher, yielding an incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER) of $40,282. However, the costs of diabetes-related complications were lower with liraglutide than with exenatide ($49,784 vs $52,429, respectively). Sensitivity analysis indicated that setting patient HbA(1c) levels at the 95% upper limit reduced the ICER for liraglutide compared with exenatide to $33,086.

EvidenceFinder.ARTICLES.push(new EvidenceFinder.Article({"abstract":"BACKGROUND: A recent open-label, parallel group trial showed that liraglutide is superior to sitagliptin for reduction of HbA1c, and is well tolerated with minimum risk of hypoglycemia. Although these findings support the use of liraglutide as an effective GLP-1 agent to add to metformin, the value of liraglutide needs to be quantified in the framework of a cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis in a US setting. OBJECTIVE: This current study sets out to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness outcomes of liraglutide vs sitagliptin based on treatment effects data from the 1860-LIRA-DPP-4 52-week trial. METHODS: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model (CDM), a non-product-specific, validated computer simulation model that projects the long-term outcomes related to interventions for type 2 diabetes, is used for simulation of these interventions. In the model, patients were treated initially on one of the three treatment options: liraglutide 1.2 mg daily, 1.8 mg daily, or sitagliptin 100 mg daily, each used as add-on therapy to metformin for 5 years. After 5 years all patients switched to basal insulin treatment for the remainder of the simulation (35-year time horizon overall). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were generated for liraglutide 1.2 mg compared with sitagliptin and liraglutide 1.8 mg compared with sitagliptin. Transition probabilities, health state utility values, and complication costs were obtained from published sources. All outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum, and the analysis was conducted from the perspective of a third-party payer in the US. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test robustness of the base case scenario. RESULTS: For liraglutide 1.8 mg vs sitagliptin, the ICER was $37,234 per QALY gained, while for liraglutide 1.2 mg vs sitagliptin, the ICER was $25,742 per QALY gained. In all sensitivity analyses, including setting the change in HbA1c to the lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals, the ICERs remained below US$ 50,000/QALY, a commonly accepted threshold in the US, except for the shortest time horizon of 10 years.

RESULTS: The study included 1,465 patients with T2DM who initiated liraglutide (N = 376) or sitagliptin (N = 1,089) (mean age [standard deviation (SD)]: 54 [8.9] vs. 58 [10.8] years; 43.9% vs. 61.8% males; both P < 0.01). After controlling for confounding factors, liraglutide patients experienced 0.31% points greater reduction in A1C (0.95% vs. 0.63% points; P < 0.01) at 6-month follow-up than sitagliptin patients and were more likely to reach A1C targets of </=6.5% (odds ratio [OR]: 2.00; P < 0.01) and <7% (OR: 1.55; P < 0.01). Liraglutide patients had $994 lower mean diabetes-related medical costs ($1,241 vs. $2,235; P < 0.01), but $544 higher diabetes-related pharmacy costs ($2,100 vs. $1,556; P < 0.01) during the follow-up. No difference was found in the total mean diabetes-related costs between the two cohorts. CONCLUSION: Liraglutide showed greater improvement in glycemic outcomes than sitagliptin among adult patients with T2DM in real-world clinical practice. Although diabetes-related pharmacy costs for patients using liraglutide were higher compared with sitagliptin, these were offset by significantly lower diabetes-related medical costs, resulting in similar total diabetes-related costs between the two treatment groups.","affiliations":"Evidera, Lexington, MA, USA, Qian.Li@evidera.com.; Novo Nordisk Inc.PlainsboroUSA","articleTitle":"Real-world clinical and economic outcomes of liraglutide versus sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the United States","authors":"Li, Q.; Chitnis, A.; Hammer, M.; Langer, J.","authorsConclusion":"Liraglutide showed greater improvement in glycemic outcomes than sitagliptin among adult patients with T2DM in real-world clinical practice.

EvidenceFinder.ARTICLES.push(new EvidenceFinder.Article({"abstract":"BACKGROUND: The global clinical and economic burden of type 2 diabetes is substantial. Recently, clinical trials with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (liraglutide and exenatide) have shown a multifactorial clinical profile with the potential to address many of the clinical needs of patients and reduce the burden of disease. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of once-daily liraglutide versus exenatide BID in patients with type 2 diabetes who failed to improve with metformin and/or sulfonylurea, based on the results of a previous clinical trial in 6 European countries (Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands, and Austria). METHODS: A validated computer simulation model of diabetes was used to predict life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incidence of diabetes-related complications in patients receiving liraglutide (1.8 mg once daily) or exenatide (10 mug BID). Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects were derived from the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes 6 trial. Country-specific complication costs were taken from published sources. Simulations were run over 40 years from third-party payer perspectives. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at country-specific discount rates. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Liraglutide was associated with improvements of 0.12 to 0.17 QALY and a reduced incidence of most diabetes-related complications versus exenatide in all settings. Evaluation of total direct medical costs (treatment plus complication costs) suggest that liraglutide was likely to cost between Euro (euro) 1023 and euro1866 more than exenatide over patients' lifetimes, leading to incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per QALY gained versus exenatide of: Switzerland, CHF (Swiss francs) 10,950 (euro6902); Denmark, Danish krone [kr] 88,160 (euro11,805); Norway, Norwegian krone [kr], 111,916 (euro13,546); Finland, euro8459; the Netherlands, euro8119; and Austria, euro8516. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term projections indicated that liraglutide was associated with benefits in life expectancy, QALYs, and reduced complication rates versus exenatide.

EvidenceFinder.ARTICLES.push(new EvidenceFinder.Article({"abstract":"INTRODUCTION: For people with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) inadequately controlled with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs), evidence from both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world studies has demonstrated that treatment intensification with liraglutide offers effective glycemic control, weight reduction, and a lower risk of hypoglycemia compared to treatment intensification with insulin or additional OADs. Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are a new class of OADs that have also been shown to be effective in T2DM patients inadequately controlled with OADs. Currently there are no head-to-head RCTs comparing these to liraglutide. METHODS: We aimed to evaluate the relative efficacy, using network meta-analysis (NMA), of treatment intensification with liraglutide and SGLT-2 inhibitors people with T2DM who have been treated with metformin (alone or in combination with SU, DPP-4, and TZD). We performed a systematic literature review to identify relevant RCTs comparing liraglutide (1.2 and 1.8 mg), canagliflozin (100 and 300 mg), empagliflozin (10 and 25 mg), or dapagliflozin (5 and 10 mg) to placebo. To strengthen the indirect evidence base, we also included non-placebo RCTs where sitagliptin (100 mg) was the active comparator. Bayesian NMA was performed on the following outcomes to assess the relative efficacy and safety of interventions: reduction (change) in HbA1c, weight, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) as well as proportion reaching target HbA1c (<7%), and risk of hypoglycemia. Doses for each intervention were considered separately. RESULTS: A total of 16 RCTs were identified. All trials were similar with respect to important baseline characteristics and study design. Both doses of liraglutide were generally statistically significantly superior to the SGLT-2s with respect to change from baseline in HbA1c and FPG as well as odds of reaching target HbA1c <7%. For weight, canagliflozin 300 mg was superior to liraglutide 1.2 mg, and SGLT-2s were generally associated with larger change from baseline in weight. For risk of major or minor hypoglycemia, no differences were found between treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to SGLT-2 inhibitors, liraglutide offers improvement in HbA1c and FPG. Reductions in weight are likely comparable between liraglutide and SGLT-2s. Liraglutide did not differ from SGLT-2s in terms of risk of hypoglycemia. Given the lack of head-to-head evidence, this analysis provides valuable insight into the comparative outcomes of liraglutide versus SGLT-2 inhibitors.","affiliations":"","articleTitle":"Liraglutide Versus SGLT-2 Inhibitors in People with Type 2 Diabetes: A Network Meta-Analysis","authors":"Lorenzi, M.; Ploug, U.
